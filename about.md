Hi there~

I am a web developer, working in Chengdu, China at present.

I share my ideas at this website (eynol.github.io).

I can speak Mandarin, Sichuan dialect and English. I am planning to learn Japanese so that I can speak four languages :) .

I am facing my struggle in my life.

I want to write novels or create something.

I love cyberpunk.

My personal homepage is [https://www.heitaov.cn](https://www.heitaov.cn).
